# Data folder
This folder contains dataset, trained models, and images outputed during
training and analysis.

* **datasets**: several version of our dataset. ̀DATASET_test.obj` is for
  debugging purposes. ̀DATASET.obj` is the full dataset. Unfortunately, those
files are to heavy for github. They are therefore hosted on other folders. Send
me an e-mail if you want them.
* **models**: Several saved trained models.
* **raw & processed**: MNIST dataset files
* **SOUND**: some sounds gathered from our models here and there (nothing
  serious, but it was fun)
* **CNN, CQT, MNIST, RNN**: image folders for each model we trained

If you need any of the missing files, send me a message.
